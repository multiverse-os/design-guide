# C Experiments 
List C experiments, the purpose, and include the code. This will develop into a
more sophisticated system, but for now this provides us with ways for other
Multiverse OS developers to replicate their code, test ideas, experiment with
different techniques, and find the best ways to develop with C. The results will
be included in our design documents to ensure developers use the best practices
and consistent coding; and where we can not find common ground, we will build
linters and translators, to convert one style to another so that code can be
merged together by either side without issue.
