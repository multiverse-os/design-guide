# C++ 
Multiverse OS will need to maintain C++ projects, just based on the fact that so
many high quality software projects are built in C++; and there is a reason why.
C++ never stopped getting better, and is a high quality language, and while
there are Rust and Go gaining popularity, there is no reason to believe that C++
is going to be shuddered and put on the shelf anytime soon, nor should it be. 

We welcome C++ developers to Multiverse OS, and hope they will help us select
the best software projects to include in Multiverse OS, or help us determine the
best software projects to maintain in C++.
