# Ruby 
Ruby right now is considered the de-facto scripting langauge for Multiverse OS.
In our experiments, it is replacing `bash` and `sh` in our console, but it also
is providing a sophisticated and enhanced way to create clusters of Multiverse
OS VM's using `portal-gun`. 

We are likely going to not make this a requirement, and will likely support
other languages preferred by other developers, that preform the same elegant and
readable langauge that Ruby does like `python`, and `lua` for example. And
others could be added as time goes on. 

Right now, Multiverse OS developers have already included a Ruby tool for
working with Go and Ruby easily, and Rust developers have finished a Ruby VM
that works fantastically. Multiverse OS developers have been taking what was
learned by the Rust developers and the original CRuby project to build a Go Ruby
VM for Multiverse OS, that features a special optional standard library to make
it better suited for use as a shell language.
