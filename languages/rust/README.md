# Rust 
Multiverse OS already uses Rust for the `portal-gun` emulator, and has
created a lot of small unseen experiments for various aspects of the Multiverse
OS scramble shell. Multiverse OS developers are also very interested in kernel
implementations in Rust for `portal-gun` to ensure the environment is not a
mono-culture, and enables us to make specialized minimal VMs for running a
single process, for AppVMs or ServiceVMs. 

There is a lot of potential for migrating key utilities, kernel related, or
adjacent tools, or even any GPU/GUI related tools. We have also experimented
with creating a Webkit UI like system using Servo without the Javascript engine.
