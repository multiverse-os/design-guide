## Multiverse OS Design Guide 
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)

#### Introduction
A simple interface for storing file descriptors (FDs) in memory, specifically
being developed as a subcomponent of the Multiverse OS [singularity
library](https://github.com/multiverse-os/singularity) which leverages memory
file descriptors to work with executable binary data exclusively in memory. 


The Multiverse OS design guide will cover the full range of programming  
languages used by Multiverse OS; in addition, provide both design principals,
underlying reasoning behind design decisions, and any style requirements that
are required to have code merged into the project codebase.

This documentation will also provide preferred but not required edditique 
suggestions, canned templates to maximize productivity. To communication of 
peers, submission of code to the repositories, and more. 

Currently only the [Go programming language style
guide](https://github.com/multiverse-os/design-guide/) has been initialized, but more 
language style guides are to come, including Git commit style guide.



#### Planning And Building Community Resource
Currently work is being done on software titled `journald` to establish  
community tools that encourage cooperation, communication, and increase 
developer productivity. The developer journals specifically will take 
published articles produced by Multiverse OS developeprs, including volunteers, 
and generate a product wiki, and potentially simplify or completely build the
documentaiton for the growing Multiverse OS software library.

These projects will be decentralized when possible, and if not, at least
federated with existing open source social media projects like Mastodon or other
similar projects.

The next community project is still being discussed, but is likely to be a 
hybrid providing all the functionality of a mailing-list, with a
reddit/hackerNews style link-aggregator, or forums. 
 
The other option is to bring our public, open registration git repository
system so we can migrate away from Github, as we are sincreley disapointed with
letting Microsoft aquire the biggest repositories of open source code. 
 
Another project that has been in development is a community task, or `TODO` list, 
that can filter tasks by programming langauge, skill requirement, number of other 
projects that require a given task to be completed to continue, and this is to be 
presented in a RPG style "skill tree". 

This specific "skill tree" style design is intended to provide new, or
interested volunteer developeprs a way to equickly see what they can contribute
to so they can get from being interested to actively participating as fast as
possible. Additionally, we hope it may empower volunteers to maximize their time spent 
helping the Multiverse OS project by alleivating bottlenecks, or solving tasks
that a lot of other pprojects are unable to continue without the given task
being completed, or at least develop more slowly without the task completed.
