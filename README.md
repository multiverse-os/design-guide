# Multiverse OS Design Guide 
=====

The Multiverse OS design guide will cover the full range of programming  
languages used by Multiverse, in addition to style and edditique related 
to communication fo peers, submission of code to the repositories, and 
more. 

Currently only the Go programming language has been initialized, but more 
language style guides are to come, including Git commit style guide.


Establishment of developer journals, a potential hybrid mailing-list /
link-aggregator / forums, and community task list that is being designed to
resemble a "skill tree" in some RPGs. 

This design should enable interested developeprs to equickly see the many 
places they can contribute and empower them to maximize their time spent 
helping the Multiverse OS project by alleivating bottlenecks if they begin
to emerge.
